For my portofolio, I modified theme Photon by HTML5 UP
html5up.net

Free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)


A simple (gradient-heavy) single pager that revisits a style I messed with on two
previous designs (Tessellate and Telephasic). Fully responsive, built on Sass,
and, as usual, loaded with an assortment of pre-styled elements. Have fun! :)
